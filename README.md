# Arteligno webapp

The Arteligno is a job search application which focuses for IT jobs within Europe (3 countries currently and expanding). But what makes the Arteligno app different from the other job aggregators on the internet? 

1. You can see all available multi language data for each country within one platform. You don't need to visit different url's for each country and you can search all native language job ads within the app. 

2. Arteligno offers state of the art visualization and user friendly access to the data. This makes searching much easier and quicker alltogether. 

3. Each job ad is categorized to a specific IT discipline. This is achieved with Machine Learning technologies on the multi language data. This further enhances the visibility over the job ads and lets you search for opportunities which are truly interesting to you! 

4. On top of the above, the required skills for each job are extracted from the multi language job ads, which you can use to narrow down your search.
